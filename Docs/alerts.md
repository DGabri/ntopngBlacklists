# Alerts

The following alerts generated by ntopng have been used to create blacklists:

- Possible SQL, RCE, Injection
- SSH Obsolete version

# Alert IDs

These alerts ID are extracted from each alert (`alert.flow_risk_info[ALERT_ID]`) in producer/alerts_parser.py:

- Possible SQL Injection: 40
- Possible RCE Injection: 41
- Empty or missing user agent: 42
- Possible Exploit: 68
- SSH obsolete version: 61
- Malicious Fingerprint: 79

The field `alert.info` contains the content of the possible injection or the obsolete ssh version used.

Analyzed alerts are disjoint so it is not possible to register two of the reported alerts in an alert

# Alert (blacklist) categories

1. Injection (ID: 40, 41, 68)
2. Scanner (ID: 42, 79)
3. SSH brute force
